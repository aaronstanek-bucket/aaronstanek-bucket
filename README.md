**Welcome to the Island of Misfit Toys!**

Hi, I'm
[Aaron Stanek](https://github.com/aaronstanek).

Sometimes my personal projects don't get finished.
And that's ok.

Common reasons why I don't finish projects:
- I realize that the project was a bad idea and should
have never gotten any of my attention
- The project was a good idea, but it's not releasable
and it's not worth my time to continue developing it
- My code is broken and completely unsalvageable
- I got bored halfway through development

Instead of deleting all these projects,
or letting them clutter up my personal
GitHub account, I put them here.

Most don't have documentation;
use at your own risk.
Most don't have licenses;
I consider them to be in the public domain.

I'm pretty sure that most of the stuff here is
garbage, but maybe someone can find something
worth completing.
